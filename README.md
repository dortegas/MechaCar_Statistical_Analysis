# MechaCar Statistical Analysis

## Overview
The newest AutosRUs’ prototype MechaCar is suffering production troubles which blocking the manufacturing team’s progress. Therefore, the data analytics team needs to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team making the following:
  - Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
  - Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
  - Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
